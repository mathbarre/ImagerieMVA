# ImagerieMVA

This is an implementation of the method presented in **-R. Giraud, V.-T. Ta and N. Papadakis: Superpixel-based Color Transfer
IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP), 2017** which can be found here : https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01519644/file/Giraud_SCT_ICIP17.pdf

To make it all work, you should also include https://github.com/frcs/colour-transfer from **François Pitié**, in your folder.

To test the implementation, you can launch MainTest.m and test with your images and parameters of your choice.
